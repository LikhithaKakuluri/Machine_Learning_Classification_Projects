All the ml classification algorithms are used on different datasets 
1) Rock Vs Mine Prediction :It describes whether the given input from submarine is rock or marine.it includes Data Preprocessing,Model Training,Model Evaluation,Building a Predictive System (Logistic Regression)
2) Diabetes Prediction :It detects Whether the person has diabetes or not,It includes data preprocessing,model training,model evaluation,building a predictive system (SVC)
3) Credit Card Fraud Prediction:It detects Whether the transaction is normal or fraudalent,It includes data preprocessing,model training,model evaluation,building a predictive system. (Logistic Regression)
4) Loan Status Prediction:It is used to describe whether the loan is approved or not ,It includes Data PreProcessing,Data Analysis,Model Training,Model Evaluation,Building a predictive System(Support Vector Machine)
5) Wine Quality Prediction:It is used to describe and predict the quality of wine.It includes Data PreProcessing ,Data Analysis,Model Training,Model Evaluation and Building a Predictive System(Random Forest Classifier)
6) Parkinson Disease :It is used to detect and predict whether the person is suffering from parkinson disease or not,and build a predictive system.(Support Vector Machine)
7) Titanic Survival Prediction:It is used to detect and predict whether the person is survival or not after the titanic accident incident,and build a predictive system. (Logistic Regression)
8) Breast Cancer Classification:It is used to classify whether the person is suffering from what type of cancer whether it is of Malignant or Benign type of tumor and built a predictive system for the trained model. (Logistic Regression)
